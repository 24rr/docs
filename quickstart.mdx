## Getting Started with Pulsery API

This guide will help you quickly get started with integrating the Pulsery API into your application.

### API Basics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="globe" title="Base URL">
    All Pulsery API endpoints are accessible at the following base URL:
    ```
    https://api.pulsery.live
    ```
    Make sure to use HTTPS for all API requests to ensure secure communication.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Response Format">
    All API responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses include the requested data, while error responses include an `error` field with a description of what went wrong.
    
    Example error response:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Resource not found",
      "message": "The requested resource could not be found"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Making Your First API Request

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Using cURL">
    You can use cURL to make API requests from the command line. Here's an example of how to get all exploits:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.pulsery.live/api/exploits" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```
    
    To get a specific exploit by name:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.pulsery.live/api/exploits?exploit=ExploitName" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="js" title="Using JavaScript">
    Here's how to make API requests using JavaScript with the Fetch API:
    
    ```javascript
    // Get all exploits
    fetch('https://api.pulsery.live/api/exploits')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
    
    // Get a specific exploit by name
    fetch('https://api.pulsery.live/api/exploits?exploit=ExploitName')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="python" title="Using Python">
    Here's how to make API requests using Python with the requests library:
    
    ```python
    import requests
    
    # Get all exploits
    response = requests.get('https://api.pulsery.live/api/exploits')
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
    
    # Get a specific exploit by name
    params = {'exploit': 'ExploitName'}
    response = requests.get('https://api.pulsery.live/api/exploits', params=params)
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
